            <p><li>Blogger is an American online content management system (CMS) which enables multi-user blogs with time-stamped entries.<br>Pyra Labs developed it before being acquired by Google in 2003. Google hosts the blogs, which can be accessed through a subdomain of blogspot.com. Blogs can also be accessed from a user-owned custom domain (such as www.example.com) by using DNS facilities to direct a domain to Google's servers.[3][4][5] A user can have up to 100 blogs or websites per account.</br></li></p>
            
            <li><p>Google Blogger also enabled users to publish blogs and websites to their own web hosting server via FTP until May 1, 2010.<br>All such blogs and websites had to be redirected to a blogspot.com subdomain or point their own domain to Google's servers via DNS.[7] Google Blogger has a wide international user base and is available in more than 60 languages, despite its decline in popularity in the United States.</br></li></p>
            
           <p><li>Pyra Labs launched Blogger on August 23, 1999. It is credited with popularizing the format as one of the first dedicated blog-publishing tools.<br>Pyra Labs was purchased by Google in February 2003 for an undisclosed amount. Premium features, which Pyra had actually offered for, were made free as a result of the takeover.</br><br>Evan Williams, a co-founder of Pyra Labs, leaves Google in October 2004. Picasa was acquired by Google in 2004, and Picasa and its photo-sharing service Hello were incorporated into Blogger, enabling users to upload images to their blogs.</br></li></p>
